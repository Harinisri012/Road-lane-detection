# Road-lane-detection
***
### Objective of the project
The objective of this project is to develop a lane detection system that processes video footage to identify and highlight lane markings on roadways. The system provides real-time visual feedback to drivers by overlaying lane boundaries and issuing warnings when the vehicle deviates from its lane. This solution aims to enhance road safety and assist drivers in maintaining proper lane discipline, leveraging image processing techniques such as color space conversion, edge detection, and Hough transforms.
